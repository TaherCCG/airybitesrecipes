# AiryBites Recipes

## Introduction
Welcome to AiryBites Recipes, my Milestone Project 3 for the Level 5 Diploma in Full Stack Web Application Development! This project will showcase my skills in full-stack web development by creating a dynamic and user-friendly recipe sharing application.

### Project Overview
AiryBites Recipes will enable users to create, share, and discover a variety of recipes. Users will be able to:

- Sign up and log in to their accounts
- Add new recipes with details like ingredients, preparation steps, and images
- Edit and delete their own recipes
- Browse and search for recipes shared by other users
- Interact with the community through comments and ratings
Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my ability to integrate various technologies into a cohesive and functional application, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.

### Technologies Used
To build AiryBites Recipes, I will be utilising a robust stack of technologies:

- MongoDB: For the database, providing a flexible and scalable storage solution for our recipe data.
- Flask: The web framework that will handle server-side logic and facilitate seamless interactions between the frontend and backend.
- Python: As the primary programming language, powering the backend logic and various functionalities of the application.
- JavaScript: To enhance the interactivity and responsiveness of the user interface.
- HTML: For structuring the web pages and displaying content in a meaningful way.
- CSS: To style the application and ensure an aesthetically pleasing and consistent design.
- Materialize: A modern responsive CSS framework based on Material Design, which will provide a sleek and professional look to the UI components.
